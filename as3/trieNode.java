   Structure for the Trie
   I am following a tree I found on Wikipedia, it goes as follows:
   Each node has siblings and children, the siblings represent letters that can substitute each other, and children represent letters that
   come after the parent

public class trieNode{

   public void trieNode{


   }

   public void insert{}
   public String search{}

}
